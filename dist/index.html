You can choose your own hours, and your income can range from $14 to, according to a Lyft spokesperson, a national average of $30 per hour including tips. You’ll need to feel comfortable sharing a close space with strangers and be skilled at keeping your focus during long rides. "

You can earn $25 to $100 an hour depending on the price you set. If you prefer staying home, you may be able to hold some lessons in your space (like if you’re teaching singing but your student doesn’t have a piano), or you’ll travel to the other person’s space if that’s more convenient for them.

The minimum per-job payment is $5-$10 for Instacart, depending on the assignment. And according to Glassdoor, you can earn an average hourly rate of $14 with that platform.

A 2017 survey shows workers averaging $380 per month. Taskers set their availability and work preferences (location, hourly rates, task categories, etc.) within the Tasker app up to 17 days in advance, and clients can choose from a list of available Taskers in their area.
