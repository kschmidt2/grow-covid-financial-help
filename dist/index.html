        So you want to be a millionaire? That may seem impossible, but based on Grow calculations, that’s how much most 25-year-olds today may need to retire comfortably. If you haven’t already begun saving and investing, the time to start working toward that goal is now. Luckily, the sooner you begin, the easier it is to build wealth for the future.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        We’ve put together a tool that can help you estimate how much you’ll need and can help you get started on a plan.

        To begin, we need to know how old you are now and at what age you plan to retire, so we can calculate how long you’ll have to save. 
    </p>
    <div class="calc-input">

        While the current average retirement age among retirees is about 60 years old, that’s expected to increase for younger generations. Americans born in 1960 or later can access partial Social Security benefits at age 62 and full benefits at age 67. Some experts recommend holding off on collecting until age 70 because Americans are living longer, meaning your savings need to last longer.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        If you’re not sure what to choose, consider going with the default age of 67.

        How much money you make will determine how much you’ll need to maintain your standard of living in retirement, as well as how much of your income you should contribute to a 401(k) or other savings plan.

        This calculator assumes a 2% annual increase in your income. If you would like to use a different number, enter it below.

        Over time you should see an average annual growth of 5-10%, not counting inflation. Some experts advise you to use a conservative estimate of 5-6% since it’s better to end up with too much money than too little. Others say you can safely use 8%, which has been roughly the compound annual growth rate of the S&P 500 since 1980. 
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        For simplicity, we’ll start you off at 6%. If you want to be more conservative or more optimistic, you can adjust this number below.
    </p>
    <div class="calc-input">
        <label for="annual-growth">Expected annual growth</label>
        <input type="number" name="annual-growth" v-model.number="annualGrowth"></input>

    <div class="calc-subhead">How much you need</div>
    <p class="body-text">
        Now comes the tricky part: figuring out how much you’ll need to save to live comfortably in retirement. Generally, experts say you’ll need 70 to 80% of your income each year to maintain your standard of living, but that isn’t the case for everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Owning a house outright by the time you retire will cut down on your cost of living by eliminating a rent or mortgage payment from your monthly expenses. But Millennials are waiting longer to purchase homes than previous generations, and have lower home ownership rates, so many will not reach this milestone by the time they retire. Also, you should expect healthcare spending to increase in retirement, potentially offsetting any savings in housing costs.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Lifestyle factors and preferences will also affect how much you spend. When you think of your retirement years, do you picture traveling the world on luxury cruise liners, or spending quiet time at home with family? Keep in mind that unless you plan to embark on a second career, you will be filling the hours you spent working with leisure, and leisure can get expensive. If you’d like to live a more active lifestyle in retirement, you should add six percentage points to your annual retirement budget.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Your salary at retirement will also affect the percentage of that income you need to have saved. Generally, the more money you make, the lower percentage you need to cover your expenses when you’re retired.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        And remember, you do need to pay taxes on withdrawals from any tax-deferred investments, like a 401(k), but you of course will not need to set aside a portion of your income to save for retirement.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        We’ll start you off with an annual spending goal determined by the income you entered above. You can make adjustments based on the expectations you have for your post-work years.
    </p>
    <div class="calc-input">
        <label for="retirement-income">Annual spending goal</label>
        <input type="number" name="retirement-income" v-model.number="retirementIncome"></input>
    </div>
    <p class="body-text">
        Finally, do you want to factor in your estimated Social Security payments?
    </p>
    <div class="calc-input">
        <input type="radio" name="social-security" v-model="socialSecurity" value="yes"></input>
        <label class="radio-label" for="yes">Yes</label>
        <input type="radio" name="social-security" v-model="socialSecurity" value="no"></input>
        <label class="radio-label" for="no">No</label>
    </div>

    <div class="results" v-if="currentAge && retirementAge && income && incomeIncrease && annualGrowth && retirementIncome && socialSecurity">
        These are your results.
