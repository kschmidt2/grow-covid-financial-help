        You know you should be saving for retirement. But how much will you actually need to retire? How many lattes will you need to pass on to live comfortably in your golden years?
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        While we don’t have a crystal ball to tell you how your money will grow during your working years, or how much you’ll spend during your retirement, we do have a tool that can estimate these numbers and help you get started on a savings plan.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Follow along and enter your information below to get a personalized savings goal. Try to be as accurate as possible, but remember that anything in the future is just an estimate.

        To begin, we need to know how old you are and when you plan to retire, so we can calculate how long you’ll have to save. Though it may be difficult to think about when you’ll retire at this point in your life, try to make an educated guess based on factors such as your age and earnings.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        While the current average retirement age among retirees is about 60 years old, that number is expected to increase for younger generations. Americans born in 1960 or later can access partial Social Security benefits at age 62 and full benefits at age 67. Some experts recommend holding off on collecting ’til age 70. If you’re not sure what to choose, go with the default age of 67.

        How much money you make will determine how much you’ll need to maintain your standard of living in retirement, as well as how much of your income you should contribute to a 401(k) or other savings plan.

        While your investments might not grow every single year, over time you should see an average annual growth of 5-10%, not counting inflation. Some experts advise you to use a conservative estimate of 5-6% since it’s better to end up with too much money than too little. Others say you can safely use 8%, which has been roughly the compound annual growth rate of the S&P 500 since 1980.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Your growth rate will also depend on the makeup of your investment accounts. Stocks carry a higher risk than cash or bonds, but can also offer greater returns. For simplicity, we’ll start you off at 6%. If you want to be more pessimistic or optimistic, you can adjust this number below.

        Now comes the tricky part — figuring out how much you’ll need to save to live comfortably in retirement. Conventional wisdom says you’ll need 70 to 80% of your income to maintain your standard of living, but that isn’t necessarily the case for everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Owning a house outright by the time you retire will cut down on your cost of living by eliminating a rent or mortgage payment from your monthly expenses. But Millennials are waiting longer to purchase homes than previous generations, and have lower home ownership rates, so many will not reach this milestone by the time they retire. Also, you should expect healthcare spending to increase in retirement, potentially offsetting any savings in housing costs.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Lifestyle factors and preferences will also affect how much you spend. When you think of your retirement years, do you picture traveling the world on luxury cruise liners, or spending quiet time at home with family? Keep in mind that unless you plan to embark on a second career, you will be filling the hours you spent working with leisure, and leisure can get expensive. If you’d like to live a more active lifestyle in retirement, you should add six percentage points to your annual retirement budget.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Your salary at retirement will also affect the percentage of that income you need to have saved. Generally, the more money you make, the lower percentage you need to cover your expenses when you’re retired.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        And remember, you do need to pay taxes on withdrawals from any tax-deferred investments, like a 401(k), but you of course will not need to set aside a portion of your income to save for retirement.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        We’ll start you off with an annual spending goal determined by the income you entered above. You can make adjustments based on the expectations you have for your post-work years.
